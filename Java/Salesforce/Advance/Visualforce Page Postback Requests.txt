1.During a postback request, the view state is decoded and used as the basis for updating the values on the page.
2. After the view state is decoded, expressions are evaluated and set methods on the controller and any controller extensions, including
set methods in controllers defined for custom components, are executed.
These method calls do not update the data unless all methods are executed successfully. For example, if one of the methods updates
a property and the update is not valid due to validation rules or an incorrect data type, the data is not updated and the page redisplays
with the appropriate error messages.
3. The action that triggered the postback request is executed. If that action completes successfully, the data is updated. If the postback
request returns the user to the same page, the view state is updated.
4. The resulting HTML is sent to the browser.

If the postback request indicates a page redirect and the redirect is to a page that uses the same controller and a proper subset of
controller extensions of the originating page, a postback request is executed for that page. Otherwise, a get request is executed for the
page. If the postback request contains an <apex:form> component, only the ID query parameter on a postback request is returned.
